\### Results on Human3.6M

Under Protocol 1 (mean per-joint position error) and Protocol 2 (mean-per-joint position error after rigid alignment).



| 2D Detections | Error (P1) | Error (P2) |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| sh detections | 48.8mm     | 39.0mm     |
| Ground truth  | 35.8mm     | 27.4 mm    |



\### Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before proceeding:

\- Python 3+ distribution

\- PyTorch >= 1.5.0





\### Training from scratch

Download the 2D detections of [Human3.6 dataset](https://github.com/una-dinosauria/3d-pose-baseline). Put them into data folder.



If you want to reproduce the results of our pretrained models, run the following commands.

python  extraMain.py 



To test on Human3.6M, run:

python extraMain.py   --test  true



***\*Visualize\****

To visualze all the five 3D pose hypotheses generated by our model, run:

\```

python extraMain.py --sample True  

\```
